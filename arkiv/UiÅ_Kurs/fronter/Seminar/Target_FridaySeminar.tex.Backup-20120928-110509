\section{Present situation}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Economics of Monetary Union}
\begin{itemize}
\item The policy debate about the Euro crisis seems mainly to be founded  on results  discussed in standard textbooks on the economics of monetary union (see for e.g. \cite{de2012economics}).
\begin{itemize}
\item Applies mainly a standard IS-LM model framework.
\item Poorly microfounded.
\item Relies on various shortcuts.
\end{itemize}
\item \cite{sinn2012target} interpet the euro crisis based on accounting data from the Target database. Their  analysis  raises a host of interesting questions in the area of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Democratic voting system within the Eurozone (one country one vote).\\
\item Risk redistribution across countries and agents.
\item Legal issues.
\item Conventional and unconventional monetary policy.
\item \textbf{Markets vs. monetary policy interventions.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sovereign debt and interest rate spreads}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the Euro crisis purely a sovereign debt crisis?
\begin{itemize}
\item Before the U.S. financial crisis,   only Greece and Portugal had a public deficit to GDP ratio that exceeded three percent.   \end{itemize}
\item The PIIGS contries also suffer from severe external imbalances.\begin{itemize}
\item After the start of the Euro. \\
Credit driven boom cycle: Capital inflow $\Rightarrow$ Trade deficit, inflationary bubbles combined with misallocation of real resources.
\item After the U.S. financial crisis.\\
Interbank market broke down. Reallocation of wealth portfolios meant that capital markets dried up.
\item Today:\\
Countries are too expansive. Need now for  a price realignment. But so far no signs of any real deflation?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Target claims and liabilities}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Balance-of-Payments}
\begin{itemize}
\item The BOP for a country under different monetary policy regimes can be written as:\footnote{$\text{CUR.ACC}$ excess of import of goods and services and net interest rate payments over export. $\text{CAP.ACC}$ is net capital import.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Floating
\begin{equation*}
0 \equiv \text{CUR.ACC.} + \text{CAP.ACC.}
\end{equation*}
\item Fixed
\begin{equation*}
\Delta\text{RES.} \equiv \text{CUR.ACC.} + \text{CAP.ACC.}
\end{equation*}
\item Eurozone
\begin{equation*}
-\Delta\text{TC} \equiv \text{CUR.ACC.} + \text{CAP.ACC.}
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Target liabilities (TC) represent accumulated intra-Eurozone balance-of-payments deficits.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{targetcl.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Target claims and liabilities
\begin{itemize}
\item Electronic interest rate bearing assets held between the national central banks (NCBs) of the Eurozone.
\item Earn interest rate equal to ECB's main refinancing rate.
\item Without any formal redemption possibilities -- this is unlike the system applied by the Federal Reserve. \end{itemize}
\item System theoretically sustainable, but politically?
\item \cite{sinn2012target}: The Euro crisis is a balance of payment crisis.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Bretton Woods as a parallel}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bretton Woods System: Monetary agreement between U.S. and its allies after the second world war.
\item Main ingredients:
\begin{itemize}
\item U.S. dollar was kept to a fixed ratio  towards gold.
\item Other countries kept their currencies fixed toward dollar.
\item No direct regulations on money supply growth
\end{itemize}
\item First phase considered fairly successful.
\item External imbalances within the system starting from 1958.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
%\frametitle{ The process of outside money creation}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{balsheetbw.png}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The collapse of the Bretton Woods system}
\begin{itemize}
\item The process of outside money helped to finance U.S. its huge current account deficit.
\item With the outcome that dollar reserves piling up in various NCBs.\\
$\Rightarrow$ no longer a credible claim on gold.
\item 1970-1971:
\begin{itemize}
\item De Gaule: threatend to redeem dollar reserves for gold.
\item Nixon: responded by making U.S. dollar non convertible towards gold.
\end{itemize}
\item 1971: End of Bretton Woods.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Differences}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Major differences between the Bretton Woods system and the Eurozone}
\begin{itemize}
\item The  "currency ratio" is 1:1 between the countries.
\item Money transactions today are mainly electronical (Target 2-system).
\item Target claims are without formal redeemption possibilities.
\item ECB governing council in control over money base creation (one country one vote).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}

\end{frame}
\section{Market interventions and TC}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Monetary policy interventions through the Target system}
\begin{itemize}
\item Target claims and liabilities are the outcome of ECB's own interventions, and as such indirectly controllable by ECB council.
\item Mainly a reflection of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Main refinancing rate.
\item Collateral requirement.
\item Liquidity policy.
\end{enumerate}
\item The BOP equation
\begin{equation*}
\text{CUR.ACC.} + \text{CAP.ACC.}\equiv -\Delta\text{TC}
\end{equation*}
\item Monetary policy intervention through the Target system must have an impact on the market prices; either in the goods and services markets or the assets market.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Two extreme cases: }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Electronic money base growth with capital market break down
\begin{equation*}
\text{CUR.ACC.} \equiv -\Delta\text{TC}
\end{equation*}
$\Rightarrow $ Finances current account deficit.
\item Electronic money base growth with current account in balance  \begin{equation*}
\text{CAP.ACC.} \equiv -\Delta\text{TC}
\end{equation*}
$\Rightarrow $ Facilitate capital flow.
\end{enumerate}
For a country entering the bust phase of a credit driven business cycle, Target credit must either (1) postpone the necessary price realignment process or (2) transfer risk in the capital market across countries  (e.g. between investors and taxpayers).
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Monetary policy by the ECB after the U.S. financial crisis}
\begin{itemize}
\item From October 2008 to May 2009, ECB reduces its main refinancing rate from 4,25\% to 1 \%.
\item Full allotment policy (i.e. NCBs provide credit to banks in any amount given sufficient collateral)
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{ebc_creq.png}
\end{center}
\item From 2011 the NBCs of Ireland and Greece started to provide  Emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to their commercial banks.
\end{itemize}

\section{Present policy situation}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The way ahead?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dismantling of the capital market:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let the present Target system continue.
\item The European Banking Union.
\item The introduction of Eurobonds.\\
\item Outright Monetary Transactions
\item European financial stability facility. 
\end{itemize}
\item Return to markets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gradually make Target claims redeemable towards marketable assets
\\-- Hume's specie-flow mechanism from (1752).
\item Increased capital ratio for banks (Basel III).
\item Countries that find it too costly to deflate in order to regain competitiveness should exit the Euro.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
